            <h3 class="food-title">Steak</h3>
            <p class="food-description">Ribeye Steak or any steak at all, is juicy, succulent, and flavorful. And this is why I love it. Whether if I am eating at a restaurant serving steak or cooking it, it is always a privilege and something I always enjoy. </p>
        </div>
        <div class= "food-item">
            <img src="../img/sushi.jpg"/>
            <h3 class="food-title">Sushi</h3>
            <p class="food-description"> Sushi, a prominent Japanese food, is something you never can get enough of. All of the flavors and ingredients in sushi swim in your mouth like a school of fish. Not only is Sushi delicious, but it also is healthy.  </p>
        </div>    
        <div class= "food-item">
            <img src="../img/sesamechicken.jpg"/>
            <h3 class="food-title">Sesame Chicken</h3>
            <p class="food-description"> Whenever my family would go to a Chinese restaurant the first thing on the menu that would come to my mind would be Sesame chicken, or "General Tsao's Chicken." What makes this food stand out above the others is the preparation and the process. Although, the chicken in this dish is usually deep fried and is never healthy for you, I believe that every now and then, it is  unconditionally worth it.  </p>
        </div>      
        <div class= "food-item">
            <img src="../img/roastedpotatoes.jpg"/>
            <h3 class="food-title">Roasted Potatoes</h3>
            <p class="food-description"> The first time I cooked up some roasted potatoes it was almost definitely the tastiest healthy food I've made. It is crunchy, juicy, flavorful (if you season it well) and overall the best thing that could come out of potatoes. (aside from French Fries:) </p> 
        </div> 
        <div class= "food-item">  
            <img src="../img/pizza.jpg"/>
            <h3 class="food-title">Pizza</h3>
            <p class="food-description">I walk into a pizza store and immediately the fresh, cheesy and crispiness of the pizza fills the air. Pizza is one of those things that I simply can't get enough and isn't even too complicated to make.</p>
        </div>     
        <div class= "food-item">
            <img src="../img/frenchmacarons.jpg"/>
            <h3 class="food-title">French Macarons</h3>
            <p class="food-description">If I could only keep one dessert to stay with me, I would choose French Macarons. This french classic, crunches in your mouth
            and is the ultimate delicacy.</p> 
        </div>      
        <div class= "food-item">
            <img src="../img/croissant.jpg"/>
            <h3 class="food-title">Chocolate Croissants</h3>
            <p class="food-description"> One of my other FAVORITE french desserts would certainly be Chocolate Croissants. As with any flavor, Croissants are super flaky, soft, and light filled with buttery goodness. </p>    
        </div>     
        <div class= "food-item">
            <img src="../img/frenchfries.jpg"/>
            <h3 class="food-title">French Fries</h3>
            <p class="food-description"> You never can go wrong with French Fries;they are simply delicious. French Fries are my go-to side at a restauraunt that I choose and for baking. Some foods are so good, and you are not even able  to explain how they reached the throne. With French Fries? It probably has to do with the frying proccess:)  </p> 
        </div>                                                                
        <div class= "food-item">
            <img src="../img/donuts.jpg"/>
            <h3 class="food-title">Donuts</h3>
            <p class="food-description">Along with French Fries which are fried as well, donuts are also unbelievably yummy. They are sweet, buttery, crispy, and when you add the toppings and the wide range of flavors, they instantly get 10 times better.</p>

        <div class= "food-item">
            <img src="../img/cheesedanishs.jpg"/>
            <h3 class="food-title">Cheese Danishes</h3>
            <p class="food-description"> Cheese Danishes were one of the first desserts I baked and it turned out a total success. Not only do I love baking them, but it is one of the first things that come to mind when I would take a walk to the nearby bakery. In my opinion, this dessert is one of the outshiners to most of his other pastry friends. </p>

        <div class= "food-item">
            <img src="../img/wedding cake.png"/>
            <h3 class="food-title">Cake</h3>
            <p class="food-description">I'm not a giant fan of cake, but when it is done right, cake is one of my most favorite foods. Good cake is soft, light, sweet and has a sharp and balanced taste. </p>
        </div>      
        
        <div class= "food-item">
            <img src="../img/cinnamonrolls.jpg"/>
            <h3 class="food-title">Cinnamon Rolls</h3>
            <p class="food-description"> My ultimate dream is to wake up in the morning with the smell of fresh cinnamon rolls cooking in the oven. Cinnamon Rolls in my opinion, are one of the easiest desserts to bake (and eat) :) They are super gooey and are almost all of the time worth it, despite the affect it may have on your health.</p>
