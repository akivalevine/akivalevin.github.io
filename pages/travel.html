        <p class="visited-description">One of the days we were at the lodge, we visited this foreign Amazon tribe. They are so distant from the outside world, that they visit Coca, Equador once a year at most, and Quito, once in their lifetime! It was truly a memorable experience, where we got to learn about their cultures and many foods they eat. In this photo, I am trying a Yucca like plant.</p>

        <p class="visited-description">On lake Pilchocha, we went Piranha fishing and my dad caught a large Piranha. We later cooked it up with the help of the tour guide since it was kosher, and then they took the jaw out to keep as a souvenir of the front and bottom set of teeth. As of today, we still have it! </p>

        <p class="visited-description"> One of my favorite things my family visited in our excursions from the Amazon Lodge, was this giant tree native to equado.It was taller than 150 feet, and protrudes all the way up in the air through the Amazon canopy. I forgot the name of this tree, but one thing I can tell you, is that this tree would need 50 grown men  to wrap around it, until they finally made a circle around it. </p>

        <p class="visited-description">To get to the Amazon, our family first needed to fly to Quito. From there, we took a domestic flight to Coca Equador, hopped on a 3 hour speed-boat on the Rio Napo river , take a 30 minute hike to lake Pilchicocha,and finally, canoe across the lake until we got to our sight. In this photo, we are just getting off the plane, ready for the big adventure still ahead of us. </p>
